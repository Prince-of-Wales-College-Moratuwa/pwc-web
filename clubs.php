                            ways. They do science experiments and activities outside the classroom, which helps them
                            understand science better and become curious and innovative.

                            exhibits and demonstrations. These societies don't just help students learn science; they
                            also make the school a place where everyone loves to explore and discover new things about
                            the world around them.</p>
