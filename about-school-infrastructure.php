                    <p class="mb-4">The main building of Prince of Wales College is a single-story structure that houses
                        important offices. Inside, you can find the principal's office, where the school's leader works
                        to guide the institution. There's also the main office, which handles various administrative
                        tasks and supports students and staff. Additionally, the school development society office is
                        located here, where efforts to improve and enhance the college are coordinated. Despite being
                        just one floor, this building plays a significant role in the daily operations and growth of
                        Prince of Wales College.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">quote by sculptor Mr. Tissa Gunawardena, he emphasizes that a basic understanding of
                        iconography is insufficient when creating a suitable memorial for a monumental individual. He
                        explains how he departed from the prevailing trend among contemporary sculptors, who focused
                        solely on external appearances, resulting in uninspiring statues. Gunawardena's monument of
                        Charles Henry De Soysa aims to convey a message of love for humanity across generations. He
                        describes the deliberate choices he made in the statue's design, such as the humble head tilt,
                        the bouquet of roses symbolizing sentiment and love, and the traditional lamp signifying
                        enlightenment. Gunawardena also defends his decision for a golden bronze finish, connecting it
                        to the land's heritage. Overall, he seeks to create a statue that not only honors De Soysa but
                        also speaks to the deeper essence of his character and his contribution to society.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">The shrine is a remarkable creation deeply rooted in

                        Eight Noble Paths, and a single entrance, emphasizing accessibility to people from all walks of
                        life. The pillars are adorned with celestial figures holding oil lamps and conches, signifying
                        auspicious moments and the gathering of devotees. The shrine's floor consists of three tiers,
                        with intricate carvings depicting the cycle of desire, birth and death, and the journey towards
                        purity and Nirvana. At its center stands an altar with a blooming lotus and a Dhamma Chakka
                        symbol, representing the essence of Buddhism and encouraging devotees to offer flowers. Overall,
