                        considered as a major school in Moratuwa area and over the years, established its name as a
                        leading school in Sri Lanka. Over the years, Prince of Wales’ College has provided the society
                        with countless men of great caliber whom we are happy to say have served both, their school and
                        the country alike….</p>
