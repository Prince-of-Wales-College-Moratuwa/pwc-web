                        <p class="mb-4">Since the inception of the school in 1876, Prince of Wales’ College has been
                            considered as a major school in Moratuwa area and over the years, established its name as a
                            leading school in Sri Lanka. Over the years, Prince of Wales’ College has provided the
                            society with countless men of great caliber whom we are happy to say have served both, their
                            school and the country alike….</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">And now, keeping up with the fast paced world, we have launched our new,
                            official website. With the internet being a truly powerful means of reaching out to the
                            community, we believe this would aid us to bridge the gap between the school and the
                            parents, past pupils, past teachers etc. We warmly welcome all of you to be a part of this
                            and there-by keep the evergreen Cambrian spirit high amongst us all!</p>
