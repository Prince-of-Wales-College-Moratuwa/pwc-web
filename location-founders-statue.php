                <h6 class="bg-white text-start text-primary ">Written by: Mr. Tissa Gunawardena (the sculptor of the
                    statue) </h6>
                <p class="mb-4">Rudimentary knowledge in iconography is insufficient in the execution of a fitting
                    memorial for a monumental human being. It must be an embodiment of all sublime qualities in him.I
                    had to deviate from the common trend of my contemporary sculptors who concentrated mainly on the
                    outward appearence, ignoring the inner-self and turning out dull, gloomy dumb masses of some
                    material.<br><br>

                    The monument of Charles Henry De Soysa should convey a message. The love of humanity to the present
                    generation and the generations to come. I had to make the body the victim of the soul. I had to
                    envisage appropriate pose stature and symbols to make it an impressive creation. His head slant to a
                    side and down to give him a humble attitude. A bouquet of roses (Seuwandi) a flower which has the
                    power to inspire sentiment in every mortal east and west alike, pressing tenderly towards his heart.
                    <br><br>

                    Buds and full-bloomed indicates children and grown-ups symbolizes the love for humanity. He holds a
                    traditional lamp in his right hand, strectched away from his over-coat to indicate that the lamp is
                    lighted. This indication will help the keen scrutineer to create an image of the invisible flame in
                    his mind's eye. The lighted lamp symbolizes his effort to make the people enlighten. The pose i
                    selected is an arrested action of a slow walking movement. He walks slowly to prevent the flame from
                    extinguishing.<br><br>

                    The controversy about the golden bronze finish might fade away if I remind that this land is known
                    as "Thambapanni" (the land of bronze coloured sand). Charles Henry De Soysa is a son of this soil. I
                    adorn the face with a faint smile. The gaze pointed at nothing particular to give a depth and the
                    sublime effect and made the inner soul to speak, "I have done my duty".<br><br>
